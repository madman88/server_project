tag: "This project provides you with a basic framework to build your \nproject 1 nodes. This is not a complete project nor a fully \ntested and robust solution. It is your responsibility to \nextend and validate the project.\n\nCommunication:\n\nA common approach for distributed systems is to separate \ndomain requests from management (internal) requests. The \nmotivation is often driven by a need to provide the highest \npotential to prioritize and control resources. This project \nprovides a design for two networks. The connections are:\n\n   1) public for satisfying data requests\n   2) private (mgmt) for internal synchronization and \n      coordination\n\n\nStorage:\n\nA storage framework is provided to show you a way (others exists) \nto decouple domain logic from backend persistence.\n"
